# Double Linked List in C

This project contains a dynamically allocated linked list, storing odd integers at the head of the list, whereas even integers are stored at the tail.
- The size of the list dynamically changes based on the number of integers stored.
- The list maintains free space, allocating more when required.
- Nodes are able to be deallocated, the program will free up space in that case.
